Introduction to Git and GitHub

I had an interesting Read on Git sometime back and i thought i could feature that here.
    Someone said that experiments are logged on in laboratory notebooks, inventory is jotted down for future reference, students write their notes on their books for future reference as well. That means we look at it this way too. Version control is a way of documenting your code for future references as well as go back to code you have written way before.

I bet you got that. #Smartdev
After reading this tutorial youâ€™ll be able to answer the following questions:

What is version control?
What is git?
How does git work?
What is GitHub?
What is the difference between git and GitHub?
So...ðŸ¤”
What is Version Control?
It is a way to document the code you use for analysis.
It's a category of software tools that helps software developers to document and track their code over time.

What about Git!!
Git is a distributed Version Control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux Kernel, that makes tracking code over time easy and effortless.

Git:

Tracks iterative change that's made to the code one tells it to manage. Therefore, you can experiment with new ideas but always have the option to revert to a specific past version of the code you used to generate particular results.

It facilitates collaboration. You can record messages as you save each successive version so that you (or anyone else) reviewing the development history of the code is able to understand the rationale for the given edits.

Easily switches between Versions of your code.

Easily undo changes.

What is GitHub?ðŸ¤”
First, GitHub is the largest source code host in the world.
It is a United States-based global company that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git.
It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Trust me, i know one of you is still wondering, What's the difference between Git and GitHub!!ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­
Git is a version control system while GitHub hosts your git repositories and puts them on your GitHub account making them accessible from anywhere across the internet.
Git is a command line tool while GitHub is a website.
Git is installed and maintained on your local system while, GitHub is a cloud based repository hosting service.
Can't be any simpler than that!!
